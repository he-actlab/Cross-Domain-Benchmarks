# Memory Enhance 

## Description 
In this application, brain electrophysiological activity is
collected in real-time and passed through Fast Fourier Transform. Then, logistic
regression is used to decode and classify the signals to be used as biomarkers.
Lastly, Model Predictive Control is used configure the synthesized signals
depending on the classification output from the previous step. This pipeline can
be executed repeatedly to enhance memory capacity of small lab rats.
